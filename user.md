## User Story: Enhanced Defect Detection in PV Panels

**Title:** Enhanced Defect Detection and Analysis in PV Panels using Thermal Drone Imagery and Geolocation Data

**As a** solar farm manager,

**I want** an application that can process and analyze thermal images taken by drones of PV panels, classify these panels according to their defects using a machine learning model, and utilize embedded geolocation data,

**So that** I can efficiently identify, categorize, and locate defects across the solar farm. This helps in prioritizing maintenance tasks, understanding the correlation of defects with environmental factors, and improving the overall efficiency and lifespan of the solar panels.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Thermal Image Processing:** The application should be able to open and process thermal images captured by drones, highlighting areas of concern such as hotspots or uneven temperature distributions.
2. **Defect Classification:** Using machine learning, the app should classify defects in the panels, such as cracks, soiling, or delamination, and display this information in an easily understandable format.
3. **Geolocation Integration:** The app should utilize the GPS metadata from the images to plot the location of each panel on a map interface, showing where each defect is located within the solar farm.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI should provide intuitive navigation for viewing both thermal and standard images, along with defect details and map overlays.
5. **Detailed Reporting:** Users should be able to generate reports that include images, defect types, severity, and exact locations, with options for exporting this data for external use.
6. **Feedback Mechanism:** The application should allow users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the defect detection, which can be used for improving the machine learning model.
7. **Security and Data Management:** The application must ensure secure handling and storage of sensitive image data and metadata.
